1845. Seat Reservation Manager
(Medium complexity)

Design a system that manages the reservation state of n seats that are numbered from 1 to n.

Implement the SeatManager class:

SeatManager(int n) Initializes a SeatManager object that will manage n seats numbered from 1 to n. All seats are initially available.
int reserve() Fetches the smallest-numbered unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.
void unreserve(int seatNumber) Unreserves the seat with the given seatNumber.
"""


class SeatManager:

    def __init__(self, n: int):


    def reserve(self) -> int:


    def unreserve(self, seatNumber: int) -> None:


# Your SeatManager object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = SeatManager(n)
# param_1 = obj.reserve()
# obj.unreserve(seatNumber)
